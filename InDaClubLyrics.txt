Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a f___
cause it's not your birthday!
[Chorus (2x)]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami i got the X ,if you into takin drugs
Im into havin s__ i aint into makin love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
[Verse]
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
n____s heard I f___ with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna f___
But homie ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut that n____ roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp(Im ight)
In the hood, In L.A, they saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them n____s'll tell ya im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go
[Chorus (2x)]
[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look n____ i done came up and i ain't change.
[Verse]
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
n____ you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that f__got a__ n____ trying to pull me back right?
When my jaws get to b__pin in the club it's on
I wink my eye at you b____, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the m_________er burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the n____s hate then let 'em hate
and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit a bottle of bub
They know where we f___in' be
[Chorus (2x)]
[Talking]
[Laughing] Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either n____, but i lo chupe a junior yeah
In the club all the time n____, its about to pop off n____
